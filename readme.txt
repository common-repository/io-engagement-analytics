Finished Reading rate certainly gives you an understanding whether your readers were interested enough in the content provided. It shows you the percentage of readers that actually scrolled the article to the very end.

Not only you see the readibility rate, you also can track how your audience consumes publication from the top to the bottom using our Scrolling map.

It is quite straightforward, yet really informative. 

The article is divided into 4 equal parts.  The percentages above each part stand for the percentage of readers who started reading it, i.e. 100% started reading the article, 80% made it to the half of the text and only 61% actually finished reading it.

##How to Add Google Analytics in WordPress Theme##

This approach is for users of Google Analytics and Wordpress who are comfortable working in website code. It’s worth bearing this in mind, as the code you create will vanish if, in the future, you decide to remove, change or revise the WordPress theme you are working with. 

This link - copy paste code snippets in WordPress demonstrates exactly how to add the code to WordPress files. An easy to follow guide before you go ahead and undertake the next steps shown below.

###Insert the code in header.php file### 
1. Basically rewrite the header.php file in the WordPress theme, and then go ahead and paste this code which you copied in step 4 after the <body> tag. 
2. Step 2 is to essentially save the amendments you have already made, and then upload this file back to the server that you are working on. 

###Add via Functions File### 
It’s possible to install the tracking code for Google Analytics in WordPress to the WordPress functions file. What this will do is install the tracking code to each page of content within your WordPress website.

##How to Perceive Reports applying Google Analytics##  WordPress Google Analytics is extremely efficient at the process of reporting on a variety of important information, accumulated from your website content. This information can be viewed on the Google Analytics dashboard.

Each section on Reporting is divided into individual labels. By clicking on a label, it will expand to reveal more options.

**Real-time** - This report will show you a real-time view of your website traffic.

**Audience** – This tab allows you to see reports which assist you in understanding how your visitors are using your website.

##Detailed Google Analytics WordPress Reports## 
Many different reports can be generated from the Google Analytics dashboard, and these reports are dependent on:

* Your business
* Your personality type
* The type of data you require
* The level of analytics you require
* What kind of marketer you are

The first thing to do in this reports section is to divide the information into segments, making them simple to manage.

Dashboards can be made, generated from different metrics, dependent on the marketing aims of your business.

Some key items to consider when creating your bespoke dashboards are:

1. Consider the Visitor. Who is this dashboard for? Reporting within the company? Your customer? Consider who will be using the dashboard, and what their needs might be.  

2. Housekeeping. 6-9 charts on each specific dashboard is a good amount for the average business. Start simple, and build up as you create more and more analytical data to work with.

3. Topics. A nice suggestion here is to categorise your dashboards by topics/subjects. 

##Google Analytics - Data Goals##

In order to precisely examine all the interactions users are making with your website content, you can use the Google Analytics Data Goals feature to establish data goals.  

Data goals vary, and are focused on your kind of business - for example, an ecommerce website would look to add a page that their users are navigated to, which would confirm their sale they’ve made; this page would offer reassurance to the user that they have successfully placed their order and made payment. 

A **Thank You** page that visitors are navigated to after successfully subscribing to your online mailing list offers the same reassurance as the confirmation of sale page. This would be done via the use of an embedded contact form within your website. 

WordPress Google Analytics can examine website conversions, which are centered on which data goals you have decided to set for your online content. Once you’ve got some conversion data to work with and examine, decisions can be made if this particular data goal approach is working for your website, and creating more conversions – if this is your overall data goal!

The data you can collect is determined by the information you give to WordPress Google Analytics, as to what you determine as goals. Then when your website visitors navigate that particular journey, WordPress Google Analytics will mark these journeys as conversions, and report accordingly. 

Once you have this information to hand, the ball is in your court to adjust your website pages as necessary, dependent on your findings. The changes you make can be made with the reassurance that the information is backed up by analytical data.
